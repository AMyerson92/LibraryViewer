Set up Project Environment

Create a new Python project.

Set up a virtual environment (python -m venv venv).

    Install necessary dependencies (e.g., pip install sqlite3 if you're using a database).

Design Data Structure

Define a Book class with attributes like title, author, and genre.

    Set up methods to modify and access book attributes.

Create Storage System

Decide whether to use a local file (JSON, CSV) or a database (SQLite) for storing books.

If using SQLite, create a database schema with a table for books (fields: id, title, author, genre).

    If using a file, design the format for storing book information (JSON or CSV).

Create Functions for CRUD Operations

Add Book: A function to add a new book (input: title, author, genre).

Update Book: A function to update a book's information (based on id or title).

Remove Book: A function to remove a book from the system by id or title.

List Books: A function to list books by a filter (e.g., by author, genre, or title).

    Search Books: A function to search for books by title, author, or genre.

Create Command-Line Interface (CLI)

Build an interactive command-line interface to allow users to input commands.

Implement options for adding, updating, removing, and listing books.

    Handle user input and display appropriate messages (e.g., success, error).

Error Handling

Ensure proper error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., trying to remove a book that doesn’t exist).

    Provide helpful error messages for common issues.

Testing and Debugging

Test all CRUD operations thoroughly (adding, updating, removing, and listing books).

    Check edge cases (e.g., removing a book that doesn’t exist, updating with invalid data).

Optional Features

Allow sorting of books by title, author, or genre.

Implement file backups or database export functionality.
